Work on a new branch for each feature. Write tests for each feature _before_ implementing.

**Use TDD** to implement the following features:
  - If a user adds `Coke`, replace it with `Water`
  - A method that removes the last item
  - Automatically capitalize the first letter of an item
  - Automatically merge existing items. E.g. Adding Coke 1 and Coke 3 = Your list contains Coke 4

**Beast mode:**

  - Save the list to a file
  - Turn the app into a command line app. Display a welcome screen and allow the user to add items via terminal (Google: ruby test puts)
